This file contains airmass-independent correction factors (AICFs) determined
offline by comparison against in situ data. CO2, wCO2, lCO2, CH4, and H2O use AICFs 
determined as the weighted mean ratio of TCCON to in situ Xgas values. N2O
uses the ratio of TCCON to surface-derived in situ XN2O fit to a mid-tropospheric
potential temperature of 310 K, ensuring that it is fixed to the same temperature
as the ADCFs. CO, H2O, and Luft are not corrected.
For CO2, wCO2, lCO2, CH4, H2O, and CO the AICF_Err (uncertainties) are 2-sigma standard 
deviations of bootstrapped mean ratios. For N2O, the error equals the fit vs. potential 
temperature multiplied by twice the standard deviation of potential temperatures 
experienced by the TCCON network.
The WMO_Scale column gives the WMO scale from the in situ data that the scale
factor ties to. There must be something in this column and must be quoted; 
use "N/A" for gases with no WMO scaling. NB: although CO has no WMO scale (because it
is not scaled), the uncertainty was determined from the measurements on the WMO X2014A scale.
