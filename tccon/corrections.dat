Contains airmass-dependent and airmass-independent (in situ)
correction factors to be applied to the column-averaged mole fractions.
The former (ADCF) is determined offline from the symmetric component
of the diurnal variation using program derive_daily_airmass_correction.
The latter (AICF) is determined offline by comparisons with in situ
profiles  using the program derive_insitu_correction
