2. USE OF DATA

These data are made freely available to the public and the scientific
community in the belief that their wide dissemination will lead to greater
understanding and new scientific insights.  The availability of these
data does not constitute publication of the data.  We expect all users
to assure that the authors receive fair credit for their work.  If the
data are obtained for potential use in a publication or presentation
the authors should be informed at the outset of the nature of this work.
If the data are essential to the work, or if an important result or
conclusion depends on the data, co-authorship may be appropriate.
This should be discussed at an early stage in the work.  Manuscripts
using the data should be sent to the authors for review before they
are submitted for publication, so we can insure that the quality and
limitations of the data are accurately represented.

3. RECIPROCITY

Use of these data implies an agreement to reciprocate.  Individuals
making similar measurements agree to make their own data available to
the general public and to the scientific community in an equally complete
and easily accessible form.  Modelers are encouraged to make available to
the community, upon request, their own tools used in the interpretation
of this data, namely well-documented model code, transport fields, and
additional information necessary for other scientists to repeat the work
and to run modified versions.  Model availability includes collaborative
support for new users of the models.

6. INTRODUCTION

Column-average Dry Mole Fractions (DMF) reported in this file were
acquired using a Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) located at the
Southern Great Plains site (36.604 N, 97.486 W, 320 m above sea level). 
More information about the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program and 
the Southern Great Plains facilities can be found at 
http://www.arm.gov/sites/sgp.stm. More information about the Lamont FTS 
container can be found at https://tccon-wiki.caltech.edu/Sites/Lamont.

Direct solar spectra were acquired in the near-infrared spectral region. 
These spectra were used to retrieve column abundances of CO2, O2, CH4, 
N2O, HF.

A description of a similar observatory, spectral retrievals and 
calibration procedure are given in

Washenfelder, R.A., G.C. Toon, J-F. Blavier, Z. Yang, N.T. Allen

dioxide column abundances at the Wisconsin Tall Tower site, Journal of
Geophysical Research, 2006, 111, doi:10.1029/2006JD007154.

Since then, the calibration procedure has evolved. An airmass-correction
is performed for XCO2 which accounts for the fact that due to spectroscopic
inadequacies, XCO2 at all sites is SZA-dependent. This procedure is described 
in https://tccon-wiki.caltech.edu/Air_Mass_Correction_Take_II

7. GENERAL COMMENTS ON THE DATA

Dry column-average CO2 DMF has been calculated according to

CO2 DMF = 0.2095 x column CO2 / column O2.

Column CO2 is retrieved for two CO2 bands centered at 6228 cm-1 and
6348 cm-1.  Column O2 is retrieved from the electronic band centered at
7882 cm-1.  The average of the two calculated CO2 DMFs is presented here.

The dry column-average CO2 DMF (0.2095 x column CO2 / column O2) is
affected by three main sources of error:

1. Measurement precision
The standard deviation of column CO2 / column O2 during a one hour period
is better than 0.1% under clear sky conditions and ~0.2% under partly
cloudy conditions.  Repeatability of the measurement is not a significant
source of error.

2. Spectroscopic errors
The retrieved O2 columns were NOT reduced by 2.27% to bring them into
agreement with the dry surface pressure, as described in Washenfelder et
al. (2006).  The absolute accuracy of the CO2 retrievals was calibrated
by comparison to integrated aircraft profiles, resulting in a correction
of 0.99.  The standard deviation of the fitting residuals is ~0.1%. 
The aircraft profiles were performed with the sun
at airmass 1.1 to 2.0 (SZA 25 to 60 deg), and the column-average CO2 DMF is
now well-calibrated for these values.  However, additional systematic
errors may be present at higher airmass due to errors in the spectroscopy
of CO2 and or O2. 

3. Systematic instrumental changes over time
Retrieved O2 DMF increased by ~0.3% during the observation period reported
here. We believe that this error affects both the CO2 and O2 retrievals
similarly, but for now assume that the column CO2 / column O2 ratio may
also have a systematic error of 0.3% over the observation period.

In summary, the measurement precision of ~0.1% under clear sky and
~0.2% under partly cloudy conditions does not affect the accuracy of the
measurements.  However, spectroscopic errors introduce a systematic bias
which depends on airmass.  We have calibrated the FTS column retrievals
at airmass 1.1 to 2.0 during Jul to Aug 2004, and expect that the absolute
accuracy at these airmasses has been maintained within 0.3% throughout
the subsequent data record.
