File specifies time periods that should be manually flagged in the
.oof and .private.nc files:
   Time1    first date to flag in YYYYMMDD format
   Time2    last date to flag (inclusive) in YYYYMMDD format
   Flag     value to assign to the flag column/variable for this time period

If this file is present in $GGGPATH/tccon as "xx_manual_flagging.dat" (where
"xx" is the site ID) then any spectra in one of the date ranges listed below
will have the value in the "flag" column of the .oof file and the "flag"
variable of the .private.nc file set to the value given in the flag colum
below.

The following values are accepted flag values:

* 1 = poor ILS
* 2 = poor tracking
* 3 = incorrect surface pressure
* 9 = other

4 through 8 are reserved for future meaning. In the .oof, .oof.csv, and
.private.nc files, these flag values will be multiplied by 1000 and added
to the automatic QC flag. That is, for a time block set to manual flag = 1,
spectra with an automatic flag of 0 would end up with a flag of 1000, and
spectra with an automatic flag of 22 would end up with a flag of 1022.
