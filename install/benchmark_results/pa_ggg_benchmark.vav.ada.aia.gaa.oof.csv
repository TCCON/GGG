6. INTRODUCTION

Column-average Dry Mole Fractions (DMF) reported in this file were
acquired using a Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) located at the
Wisconsin Tall Tower site (45.945 deg N, 90.273 deg W, 442 m above
sea level).  Direct solar spectra were acquired in the near-infrared
spectral region.  These spectra were used to retrieve column abundances
of CO2 and O2.

A description of the observatory, location, spectral retrievals
and calibration procedure are given in

Washenfelder, R.A., G.C. Toon, J-F. Blavier, Z. Yang, N.T. Allen
P.O. Wennberg, S.A. Vay, D.M. Matross, and B.C. Daube, 2006, Carbon
dioxide column abundances at the Wisconsin Tall Tower site, Journal of
Geophysical Research, 2006, 111, doi:10.1029/2006JD007154.

Since then, the calibration procedure has evolved. An airmass-correction
is performed for XCO2 which accounts for the fact that due to spectroscopic
inadequacies, XCO2 at all sites is SZA-dependent. This procedure is described in
https://tccon-wiki.caltech.edu/Air_Mass_Correction_Take_II

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. GENERAL COMMENTS ON THE DATA

Dry column-average CO2 DMF has been calculated according to

CO2 DMF = 0.2095 x column CO2 / column O2.

Column CO2 is retrieved for two CO2 bands centered at 6228 cm-1 and
6348 cm-1.  Column O2 is retrieved from the electronic band centered at
7882 cm-1.  The average of the two calculated CO2 DMFs is presented here.

The dry column-average CO2 DMF (0.2095 x column CO2 / column O2) is
affected by three main sources of error:

1. Measurement precision
The standard deviation of column CO2 / column O2 during a one hour period
is better than 0.1% under clear sky conditions and ~0.2% under partly
cloudy conditions.  Repeatability of the measurement is not a significant
source of error.

2. Spectroscopic errors
The retrieved O2 columns were NOT reduced by 2.27% to bring them into
agreement with the dry surface pressure, as described in Washenfelder et
al. (2006).  The absolute accuracy of the CO2 retrievals was calibrated
by comparison to integrated aircraft profiles, resulting in a correction
of 0.99.  The standard deviation of the fitting residuals is ~0.1%.
The aircraft profiles were performed with the sun
at airmass 1.1 to 2.0 (SZA 25 to 60 deg), and the column-average CO2 DMF is
now well-calibrated for these values.  However, additional systematic
errors may be present at higher airmass due to errors in the spectroscopy
of CO2 and or O2.

3. Systematic instrumental changes over time
Retrieved O2 DMF increased by ~0.3% during the observation period reported
here. We believe that this error affects both the CO2 and O2 retrievals
similarly, but for now assume that the column CO2 / column O2 ratio may
also have a systematic error of 0.3% over the observation period.

In summary, the measurement precision of ~0.1% under clear sky and
~0.2% under partly cloudy conditions does not affect the accuracy of the
measurements.  However, spectroscopic errors introduce a systematic bias
which depends on airmass.  We have calibrated the FTS column retrievals
at airmass 1.1 to 2.0 during Jul to Aug 2004, and expect that the absolute
accuracy at these airmasses has been maintained within 0.3% throughout
the subsequent data record.
