GGGAVG    version 2.5.0     3-Sep-2005   GCT
  A major revision that accomodates the new runlog format in which
  InGaAs and Si (HgCdTe and InSb) are both in the same runlog file.
  Assumes runlog is chronological so that different runlog records
  with the same time are treated as equivalent. For example, runlog
  allows o2_7885 to be averaged with o2_13082 even though they
  correspond to different (alternating) records of the runlog file.

  This new scheme will automatically accomodate instruments with
  N (>2) detectors obtaining spectra simultaneously, whereas the
  old scheme (parallel runlog files) would have required software
  mods to be able to do this.

  Also simplified gggavg such that if a .col file is missing,
  it crashes, whereas previously it slickly continued with the
  next .col file in the multiggg.bat file. I prefer to know if
  something is wrong. If the header part of the .col file exists,
  but there are know data records (e.g. if the frequency range of
  the window doesn't match the spectrum) then it counts those as
  missing data.

GGGAVG    version 2.4.0    11-Mar-2004   GCT
  Added an additional auxiliary parameter: pins
  So now naux=15.

GGGAVG    version 2.3.1    23-Feb-2004   GCT
  Now calls the new readrunlog subroutine, which necessitated
  various variables the were previously declared as R*8 to be
  changed to R*4.

GGGAVG    version 2.3.0    23-Apr-2003   GCT
  In response to the change in the GFIT output format (replaced
  cl_err by Zoff), I changed the parameter list (and format) for
  reading the .col files.

GGGAVG    version 2.2.1    20-Dec-2002   GCT
  Justus was having problems with the GGGAVG under the G77 compiler.
  This was due to the arrays cl_av and cl_sw not being initialized.
  They were already full of garbage as soon as GGGAVG tried to execute.
  Fixed this problem by adding the loops:
       do i=1,1200
         cl_av(i:i)=' '
       end do
       do i=1,9600
         cl_sw(i:i)=' '
       end do

GGGAVG    version 2.2.0     7-Dec-2001   GCT
  Changes the meaning of the numbers which are printed in the
  wincomp file. The 3'rd column is now the standard error on
  the scale factor. Previously, this was multiplied by the
  error weight (4'th column).
  Also decreased parameter EPS in t_fit.f from 1.e-4 to 1.e-5.
  
GGGAVG    version 2.1.0    12-Feb-2001   GCT
  Re-defined the cl_av and cl_sw arrays to avoid null characters
  being written to the column labels (which causes XYPLOT not to
  be able to read anything following them.

GGGAVG    version 2.0.0     1-Nov-00     bs
  Make changes to accomodate the new format of the .col files
  produced by GFIT.

GGGAVG    version 8.2.0    19-Jul-00     bs
  Added if statements to read the right files in the case of ATMOS
  and to read the TAB delimited ATMOS runlogs.

gggavg    version 7.3.0    14-jan-99     bs
  - the variable "record" is now a 163 characters string (increased
	from a 162 character string).
  - gsetup reads the records in a runlog file even when a retrieval
	delimiter (' ' & '-' & '+') is placed at the beginning of the
	line.
  - added a new character array of size mrow and named it sign. the
	array stores the retirieval delimiters from the runlog records
	(when present) and outputs to the average files (.av and .sw).
  - the auxiliary variable yaux(4,mrow) is now initialised in an
	if..elseif..endif statement to account for the presence of
	(lack of) the retrieval delimitar character.
