File contains the following cell status information:
   Time1    cell insertion date/time in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format
   Time2    cell  removal  date/time in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format
   Gas#     gas number (HCl=15, HBr=16, OCS=19)
   Column1  Column of gas in cell (molecules/m2) at insertion
   Column2  Column of gas in cell (molecules/m2) at removal
   Peff1    Effective Pressure (mbar) at 296K at insertion
   Peff2    Effective Pressure (mbar) at 296K at removal
   Comment  Can be any text string (e.g. spectrum name, cell length)

The Peff and Column values were obtained (by Frank Hase) using
HIT2008. Changing to a different linelist will invalidate them.
As of 20200523, atm.161 HCl was still indentical to HIT2008.
If an instrument has never had a cell, this file will contain
nothing below the column headers (line 16)

Cell length is unnecessary once the gas column is known. Ideal Gas Law:
    PV=nkT
    n/V = P/kT  (molecules/m3)
    Slant Column = Ln/V = LP/kT (molecules/m2)
Slant column is preserved in the event of an inward leak into a cell
kept at 1 atm, even though the pressure increases.

    Peff = PP_gas + PP_air*(ABHW_gas/SBHW_gas) + PP_h2o*(WBHW_gas/SBHW_gas)
Since PP_h2o =~0 for all cells, water broadening widths don't matter.
For HCl cell, ABHW_gas/SBHW_gas ~0.25   
For HBr,cell, ABHW_gas/SBHW_gas ~0.75  
For OCS,cell, ABHW_gas/SBHW_gas ~0.80
