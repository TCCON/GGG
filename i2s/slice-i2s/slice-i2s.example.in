: This is the input file for the 'slice-i2s' program.
: Comment lines start with a colon.  Use them extensively  :-)

: Parameter #1 gives the directory path to the IFS125HR slice files.
: A trailing path separator is required.

: Parameter #2 gives the directory path for the spectral files.
: A trailing path separator is required.

./spectra/

: Parameters #3 and #4 control the saving of de-sliced interferograms
: and give the directory path for the interferogram files, respectively.
: Values for parameter #3 are:
:   0 = don't save de-sliced interferograms
:   1 = save raw, de-sliced interferograms
:   2 = save SIV-corrected interferograms
: A trailing path separator is required for parameter #4.

: Parameter #7 specifies the range of channels to be processed.
: Channel 1 is the "slave" (typically InGaAs in 125HR instruments which have
: simultaneous InGaAs and Si measurements).
: Channel 2 is the "master" (typically Si in 125HR instruments which have
: simultaneous InGaAs and Si measurements).
: For example, the current TCCON-enabled IFS125HR supports the following combinations:
:   1 2 = InGaAs and Si (slave and master)
:   1 1 = InGaAs only (slave only) 
:   2 2 = Si only  /  InSb only (master only)

: Parameter #8 points to a file containing the frequency limits of
: spectral windows to be saved in the output files.

: Parameter #9 gives a pattern for the CIT file-naming convention.
: Most characters will be transcribed unchanged.  A sequence of Y's
: will be replaced by the year using the same number of characters as
: the number of Y's.  The sequence of M's and D's will be similarly
: replaced by the month and day, respectively.  The letter S gives the
: location of the light source indicator, and the letter C specifies
: the location of the channel indicator.  The run number will take the
: space occupied by the sequence of R's.

: Parameter #10 lists the possible values for the light source indicator S.
: The slice file header is used to select one of these for the external
: port (solar scans), the internal source (lamp runs), or the all off
: case (noise runs).

sln

: Parameters #11 and #12 list the possible values for the channel
: indicator C.  Parameter #11 applies to interferogram files, whereas
: parameter #12 is for the spectrum files.  In these strings, there is
: one character per data channel.

: Parameter #13 selects the format of the output files:
:   0 = no output
:   1 = ASCII file
:   2 = straight binary file without header, little-endian
:   3 = OPUS format

: Parameters #14 and #15 apply only in the case of ASCII output files.
: Parameter #14 is the field separator used between X and Y values:
: it must be guarded by double quotes to allow the space character to
: be used as field separator.
: Parameter #15 gives the number of min-max pairs in the output. Min-max
: output is used for plotting: for example, at 1200 DPI, 10000 points
: should be enough for a 8"-wide plot.  Setting this parameter to zero
: disables the min-max feature and each data sample results in a single
: output point.

: Parameter #16 controls the data quality check based on the suntracker
: total intensity.  The first number is the maximum standard deviation
: of the solar intensity scaled to the average value.  The second number
: is the minimum value of the average suntracker intensity.  Setting a
: threshold to zero eliminates that particular check.

: Parameter #17 controls the data quality check based on the minimum
: value of the ZPD peaks.  There must be one entry per data channel.
: Setting a threshold to zero eliminates that particular check.
: THIS CHECK IS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED, BUT THE PARAMETER MUST BE PRESENT.

: Parameter #18 controls the data quality check based on the minimum
: value of the cross-correlation between runs.  There must be one entry
: per data channel.
: Setting a threshold to zero eliminates that particular check.
: THIS CHECK IS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED, BUT THE PARAMETER MUST BE PRESENT.

: Parameter #19 is the number of hours that must be added to the instrument
: time to compute UT.  This number is in floating point format to allow for
: 1/2 hour time zones.  If the instrument is already set to UT (a good idea)
: simply set this parameter to 0.0.

0.0

: Parameter #20 sets the maximum number of scans analyzed in a single
: execution of the program.  The only use of this feature is to limit
: the execution time for the diagnostic checks performed during the
: night. Setting the count to zero eliminates this limit.

0

: Parameter #21 sets the maximum log-base-2 of the number of interferogram
: points used to set the spectral resolution.  A value greater than 22
: ensures that we use all points produced by the current IFS125HR.
: There must be one entry per data channel.

: Parameter #22 sets the frequency limit for the SIV-correction
: (i.e. the frequency below which any interferogram variations
: will be considered to be source brightness fluctuations (SBF) and
: removed, rather than interferometrically-modulated radiation).
: Set this value to be below the lowest limit of the optical bandpass
: of the detector.
: The higher the specified frequency, the faster the correctable
: SBF's and the faster the dc-correction (shorter smoothing operator).
: But if the frequency is set too large, the SIV-correction might start
: to try to "fix" the interferometric fringes. Don't confuse these
: frequencies with the frequency limits of the written spectrum.
: The first value represents detector 1 (slave).
: The second value represents detector 2 (master).
: If you use the slave only option (i.e., 1 1 in Parameter #7), you
: must set the first parameter appropriately for your detectorâ€™s
: spectral range. If you use the master only option (i.e., 2 2 in
: Parameter #7), you must set the second parameter below. If you only
: use one detector, it is safest to set both values below to the correct
: one.

2500. 6000.

: Parameter #23 is the type of laser sampling error (LSE, or "ghost correction")
: you wish to perform on each detector:
:  0 = No correction is to be performed for this channel.
:  1 = The slave channel (typically InGaAs) is to be used for this channel. Note
:      that this option is *not* currently supported in I2S and is disabled.
:  2 = The master channel (typically Si) is to be used for this channel. Note that
:      this is the typical TCCON setting.
:  3 = The Dohe et al. AMT, 2013 (doi:10.5194/amt-6-1981-2013) method is used to 
:      compute the LSEs, which are contained in a separate file. Note that this feature 
:      is not yet implemented and sets the LSE to zero.
:  4 = Another method is used to compute the LSEs, also contained in a separate file. This is not
:      currently implemented and sets the LSE to zero.
: Here is an example for a typical InGaAs/Si combined file. This means that
: the LSE values derived from the Si spectra are applied to both the Si and InGaAs channels.

: Parameter #24 is the length of the phase correction operator.
: It must be a power of 2, no larger than 131072

1024  1024

: Parameter #25 is the fractional intensity threshold for use of a
: spectral point in deriving the phase correction operator (PCO).
: For example, a value of 0.02 means that only the low-resolution
: points exceeding 2% of the peak spectral magnitude are used to
: define the PCO. The other weaker points are ignored and the
: phase at these frequencies is interpolated.

: Parameter #26 limits the amount of processing performed by the program.
: This is useful in checking the early stages of the processing.
: The following levels are currently supported:
:   0 = perform no processing, just parse the input file
:   1 = read all run parameters from the IFS125 slices
:   2 = as 1, plus read all information contained in the ".info" files
:   3 = as 2, plus read the interferogram data from the IFS125 slices
:   4 = as 3, plus compute the spectrum
: If file saving is turned on, level 3 saves the de-sliced interferogram,
: and level 4 also saves the resulting spectrum.

: Parameter #27 controls the verbosity of the program.
: Currently the following levels are defined:
:   1 = display program name and error messages
:   2 = adds display of warnings
:   3 = adds display of information messages
:   4 = adds display of debugging messages
:   5 = adds display of more debugging messages

: The last parameter points to the starting slice for each run.
: Since the real-time acquisition system saves the slice files
: in separate directories for each day, we need to know the
: date (year, month, day) and the save set number, in addition
: to the number of the first slice of each run.
: An IFS125 "run" contains a number of scans (parameter NSS)
: which will be separated out by slice-i2s.
: The program can handle several runs in one execution by simply
: giving as many starting slice numbers as needed.
: One can comment out old runs by placing a ':' in front of them.
